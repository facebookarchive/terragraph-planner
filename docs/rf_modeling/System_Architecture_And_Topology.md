# System Architecture & Topology

A simplified architecture is assumed for the purpose of modeling various RF
parameters as shown in the Figure 1. This is not mean to represent any
particular manufacturerâ€™s design but rather a generic communication system
architecture sketched as a reference diagram for this document. The diagram
here is simplified to represent only a P2P scenario but can easily generalized
to a P2MP scenario.

The key blocks in this system include Antenna subsystem, RF front-end and
Baseband chipset. The assumed functionalities of these blocks are described
below:

- **Antenna subsystem**: Transmit or receive radio signals in the 60 GHz
  frequency bands. This could be a single antenna or a group of multi-antenna
  system abstracted as a single entity for modeling purposes. The overall
  antenna system is generally assumed to be a directional antenna with antenna
  patterns being provided as inputs.
- **RF front-end**: This module interfaces with the antenna subsystem and
  the Baseband. The key functionality of this module is to up/down-convert
  the signals to/from higher frequencies (mixing).
- **Baseband**: As a receiver, Baseband receives down-converted signals from
  the RF front-end and extracts data (as bits) from these signals. As a
  transmitter, Baseband provides input signals to the RF front-end for
  up-conversion to higher frequencies.
