# Input Files
This page introduces the input files used in a Terragraph network plan, including
required files and optional files.

The table below describes all the input files, with its supported file formats and
parameter name in the YAML file and class attribute. The detailed requirement of the
format or structure will be introduced in each corresponding section.

| **File Type**                                       | **Required or Optional**                                                                                       | **Functionality**                             | **Supported Formats**      | **Parameter Field(s)**                      |

The input files can be generated by GIS tools, such as Google Earth and QGIS,
and some of them can be obtained by the planner tool itself.

## Boundary Polygon File
A boundary polygon file is a KML/KMZ file defining the boundary of the network
plan and containing the area of interest as a polygon for a proposed network
plan.

### Requirements
1. There should be exactly one `Polygon` geometry in the KML/KMZ file


## GeoTIFF Files
GeoTIFF Files are files defining the elevation of the surface where the plan is.
There are 3 kinds of GeoTIFF files used in the planner:
1. DSM: provides the elevation of the surface directly.
2. DTM: provides the elevation of the terrain.
3. DHM: provides the elevation of the height of construction, buildings or trees
   on the surface.

To get more accurate LOS result, please provide either DSM GeoTIFF File(s) with or
without other GeoTiff Files or DTM and DHM Together. If the later combination is
provided, the planner will get a DSM by plusing DHM over DTM.

### Requirements
1. The projection information and the coordinate reference system (CRS) should
   be correct.
2. There should be exactly one single raster band.
3. The data collection time should be no earlier than 20 years from the time
   the plan is run.
4. The linear units should be in meters.
5. The pixel size should between 0.15 meter and 35 meters.
6. The veritical projection system should be correct if provided.

## User Input Site File
The user input site file provides the location of user provided POP, DN and CN
sites, and can be either in KML/KMZ format or CSV format. All the sites in the
file are considered as candidate sites and will go through LOS checks.

### Requirements
**KML/KMZ**
1. Put POP sites under a folder whose name contain a substring "POP". Do the same
   for DNs and CNs. **Note:** Do not have a parent folder with those substrings.
   Otherwise, all the sites under this parant folder are considered as that type
   of sites.
2. Use a `Point` geometry for each site placemark.
3. Provide the information of the site via the data field.
4. The latitude and longitude are required, but the altitude is optional. When
   the altitude is not given, the planner uses `MOUNTING_HEIGHT_ABOVE_ROOFTOP`,
   `DEFAULT_POP_HEIGHT_ON_POLE`, `DEFAULT_DN_HEIGHT_ON_POLE`, or
   `DEFAULT_CN_HEIGHT_ON_POLE` to get the altitude based on the location type and
   site type.
5. If the altitude of a placemark is provided and altitude mode is absolute,
   the altitude is considered as the absolute altitude over mean sea level; if
   the altitude of a placemark is provided and altitude mode is relativeToGround,
   the altitude is considered as the relative height to the surface (DSM).
   Otherwise, the planner will infer the altitude using the default.

**CSV**
1. Only latitude and longitutde columns are required. The same rule as that in
   KML/KMZ to infer the altitude is used. If the `site_type` is not provided for
   user input site file, the sites are considered as POP by default.
2. Extra attributes of each site are welcomed, see the next subsection for more
   details.

**Site Attributes**

The following table describes all the different attributes used in User Input.

| Attribute             | Acceptable Names                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| latitude              | base_lat, latitude, lat                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| longitude             | base_lon, longitude, lon                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| altitude              | altitude, alt                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| name                  | name, site_name, site name, pole_name                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| site_type             | type, site_type, site type                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| device_sku            | sku, device_sku, device sku                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| number_of_subscribers | number_of_demand_points, number of demand points, num_demand_points, number_of_subscribers, number of subscribers, number of demand sites, num_demand_sites, demand_points, demand points, demand_sites, demand sites |
| location_type         | location type, location_type                                                                                                                                                                                          |

1. All the `Acceptable Names` are case-insensitive
2. For KML/KMZ, `device_sku`, `number_of_subscribers` and `location_type` come
   from data fields; location attributes are from the coordinates of the
   placemarks; `site_type` is inferred from the folder name.
3. **NOTE**: If the name is provided, they must be unique.


## Building Outline File
The building outline file describes the outline of the buildings in the AOI.
The planner uses the outlines to detect the site locations automatically with
the [Automatic Site Detection](Features.md#automatic-site-detection) feature.

The building outline file can be either in a zipped shapefile format or a
KML/KMZ format.

### Requirements
**General**
1. The projection information and the coordinate reference system (CRS) should
   be correct.
2. The veritical projection system should be correct if provided.
3. All the building outlines are expected to be in the `Polygon` geometry type.

**Shape file specific**
In addition to the general rules, there are some extra rules if you are using
zipped shape files.
1. All the files should be put at the top level of the zip file.
2. Only one `.shp` file, together with the corresponding `.shx`, `.prj` and `dbf`
   files should be included in the zip file.

## Candidate Topology File
The candidate topology file is only used in an optimization-only plan, and
gives a network with all the sites and links. The candidate topology file
should be in the KML/KMZ format.

The input candidate topology file can be either in a KML/KMZ format or a zipped
file of two csv files. The [Topology KML File](Output_Files.md#topology-kml-file)
from the output of a LOS plan can be reused in the optimization plan directly.

### Requirements

All the input folder names or column names are case-insensitive.

**KML/KMZ**

A KML/KMZ file can contain site, link, and demand site information.

1. Site
   1. All the rules in the KML/KMZ requirements in the
      [User Input Site File](#user-input-site-file) section are also applied.
   2. In addition, status of the site can also get parsed from the KML/KMZ input
      1. The status includes `CANDIDATE`, `PROPOSED`, `EXISTING`, `UNAVAILABLE`
         and `UNREACHABLE`. See more details at `StatusType` in [enums.py](https://github.com/terragraph/terragraph-planner/blob/main/terragraph_planner/common/configuration/enums.py)
      2. To specify the status, please put your site folder under a parent folder
         with the status type. For instance, if you give a site in the folder
         structure as `EXISTING` -> `DN` -> site, the site is considered
         as an existing DN in the network.
      3. If the status type is not specified, `CANDIDATE` will be applied.
2. Link
   1. There are three different link types, which are `WIRELESS_BACKHAUL`,
      `WIRELESS_ACCESS` and `ETHERNET`. To input the links, you are supposed
      to put links under a folder with those link type as its name.
   2. Use a `LineString` geometry for each link.
   3. Provide the information of the link via the data field. You can provide
      `TX_SITE_NAME` and `RX_SITE_NAME` for each link to specify two end sites.
      If they are not provided, the planner will pick all the sites within 10
      meter distance to the end of link as end sites.
   4. The rule 4 and 5 about altitude in the KML/KMZ requirements of
      [User Input Site File](#user-input-site-file) section are also applied
   5. All the three status rules of the sites are still applied to the links.
3. Demand
   1. Demand notion is used to provide flexibility to the user. CN locations are
      treated as physical sites that have demand on them, whereas demand points
      on their own can be used to represent imaginary locations that requires
      connectivity.
   2. You can provide the demand site in the network by providing `Point`
      placemarks under `demand site` folder in the KML/KMZ.
   3. The altitude information of demand site is ignored.
   4. All the demand points are considered as `CANDIDATE`.

**Zipped CSV**

The zip file should contain a `sites.csv` file and a `links.csv` file to
provide the information of sites and links correspondingly. Unlike KML/KMZ,
the demand site is not supported.

1. Site

   All the site attributes from the table in the [User Input Site File](#user-input-site-file)
   are still acceptable, but unlike a user input site file, there are 4 required
   attributes, which are laitutde, longitude, site_type and name.
2. Link

   You only need to specify the names of two end sites for each link, rather
   than the locations. There are three ways to specify them:

   1. A single `SITE_PAIR` column. The links are supposed to be given in
      the `{tx_site_name}-->{rx_site_name}` format. Each column means a drected
      link.
   2. A `TX_SITE_NAME` column and a `RX_SITE_NAME` column. Each column means
      a directed link.
   3. A `SITE1_NAME` column and a `SITE2_NAME` column. Each column means two
      directed links in two opposite direction for backhaul links, and one single
      directed link for access links.

   The following table shows the acceptable column names for each column type.

   | Column Type  | Acceptable Column Names                                                    |
   | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | SITE_PAIR    | site_pair, sites                                                           |
   | TX_SITE_NAME | tx_site, tx_site_name, tx_site_id, from_site, from_site_name, from_site_id |
   | RX_STIE_NAME | rx_site, rx_site_name, rx_site_id, to_site, to_site_name, to_site_id       |
   | SITE1_NAME   | site1, site1_id, site1_name                                                |
   | SITE2_NAME   | site2, site2_id, site2_name                                                |



## Base Topology File
The base topology file is similar to [candidate topology file](#candidate-topology-file),
but is used in a los-only plan or an end-to-end plan. All the sites and links
are regarded as candidate in the file.
